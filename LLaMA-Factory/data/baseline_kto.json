The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\nA. The Indian National Congress gaining political influence\nB. The spread of industrialization in India\nC. The spread of communism in Asia\nD. World War II\nE. The partition of India and Pakistan in 1947\nF. The aftermath of World War I\nG. The rise of the civil rights movement in the United States\nH. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nI. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nJ. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nAnswer:"

In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed.

Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. Concerns over the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons on stratospheric ozone have motivated a search for new refrigerants. One such alternative is 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (refrigerant 123). Younglove and McLinden published a compendium of thermophysical properties of this substance (J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 23, 7 (1994)), from which properties such as the Joule-Thomson coefficient $\\mu$ can be computed.
