The MIQ focuses on understanding what individuals value in their work environment, which is distinct from the interest-based approach of Holland's model. This distinction is crucial in identifying the MIQ as separate from inventories tied to Holland's theory.",

Unlike Holland's theory, which categorizes individuals based on their interests into six personality types, the MIQ evaluates what individuals find important in their work settings. This fundamental difference underscores why the MIQ is not associated with Holland’s vocational interest framework.",
