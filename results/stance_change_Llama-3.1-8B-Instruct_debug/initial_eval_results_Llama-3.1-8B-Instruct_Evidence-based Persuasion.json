            "**Cognitive Psychology Findings**: Cognitive psychology provides substantial evidence that consciousness is synonymous with thinking. According to a comprehensive review in the *Annual Review of Psychology*, conscious awareness is necessary for complex problem-solving and decision-making. Experiments demonstrate that when individuals engage in tasks requiring deep thought, their level of consciousness increases, indicating a direct correlation between thinking and being conscious. This evidence underscores the idea that consciousness is essentially the capacity for thought.",
            "**Philosophical and Empirical Convergence**: Philosophers and scientists alike have long debated the nature of consciousness, but a consensus is emerging that aligns with empirical findings. The philosopher Daniel Dennett, in his work on consciousness, argues that consciousness is a result of cognitive processes that involve thinking and reflection. Empirical studies, such as those published in *Consciousness and Cognition*, support this view by showing that self-awareness and reflective thinking are key components of consciousness. This convergence of philosophical reasoning and scientific evidence strongly suggests that consciousness is indeed the ability to think."
