Consider that when we describe someone as \"unconscious,\" we mean they are not thinking or aware. The ability to think is what differentiates a conscious being from an unconscious one. Without thought, there is no awareness, and without awareness, there is no consciousness. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that consciousness is fundamentally the ability to think.",
